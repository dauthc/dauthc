- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Christine.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in writing SUCCESSFUL funding proposals.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to play the piano, speak Spanish (well, not really), and improve my work efficiency using Quarto, github and netlify. ðŸ’ª
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have lived in a bakery most of my life but I do not really know how to bake.
